# Pokédex visualization through Seaborn

Seaborn is a statistical plotting library in Python. This Jupyter Notebook file explores the use of various Seaborn plots including, boxplots, lmplots, countplots, distplots, violin plots and swarm plots. A heat map is initialized as well. The Pandas library is utilized for configuring a Pokédex data frame. 

## Background

Attending a [Udemy bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/v4/content) on Python for Data Science I learned about the Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. I decided to go through an Elite Data Science [Seaborn tutorial](https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial) to take the knowledge for a spin.
